How to run:

1. Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the dependencies
2. Run python app.py
3. Place your computer a fair distance away from you and angle it down so that the model
   registers your feet and toes(A few squats may be counted in this process due to the incorrect joints being registered)
4. Start squatting! Remember you have to squat below 90 degrees for a rep to count!
